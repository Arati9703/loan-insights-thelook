💼 Data insights on loan health and borrower trends at scale — powered by Looker and BigQuery.

📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Looker dashboard built for TheLook Fintech — a growing financial technology company offering loans to independent online store owners. The goal is to equip the Treasury department with real-time insights into loan performance, borrower behavior, and geographic distribution of loans to support strategic financial decisions.

🧠 Business Scenario
TheLook Fintech, a growth-stage financial technology company, provides loans to independent online store owners to support their inventory needs. With rapid scaling underway, the Treasury department required a solution to monitor loan health and financial performance in real time.

To support strategic decision-making, the team needed clear insights into:

Cash flow trends to ensure outgoing loan disbursements remain within sustainable limits.

Primary customer loan purposes to assess risk and repayment behavior.

Loan distribution across states to mitigate regional concentration risks.

Borrower demographics, particularly homeowners with current loans, to better understand financial stability.

By integrating and analyzing data in BigQuery and visualizing it through Looker, this dashboard was developed to deliver actionable insights across these key areas.
